# Using $\LaTeX$ in Headers

A block of $\LaTeX$ code can be inserted on a line by itself surrounded by double dollar signs:
$$  \sum_{n=0} ^ {\infty} \frac {f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} \, (x-a)^{n} $$


If you want to use $\LaTeX$ markup in-line, use single dollar signs, but be sure not to have spaces immediately inside them. You should be able to use equations in the answers to questions; for example:

Which one is Bayes' Theorem?

 * $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B | A)\, P(A)}{P(B)}$
 * $e = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n$
 * E=mc<sup>2</sup>
